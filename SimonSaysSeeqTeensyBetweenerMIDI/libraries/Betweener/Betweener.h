//  Betweener.h detailed description:
//  
//  This .h file defines the Betweener class, setting up all the
//  variables and providing the "function prototypes" that tell the
//  compiler what functions the class contains.  The associated .cpp file has
//  the implementation (the actual code) for all the functions.
//
//  The purpose of the Betweener class is to set up the software mappings
//  that enable Teensy to communicate via the soldered-together connections
//  on the Betweener device itself.
//
//  The Betweener class also includes functions that allow a
//  slightly streamlined set of read/write operations so that the
//  device can mediate between CV inputs and outputs, MIDI inputs and
//  outputs, and trigger inputs.
//
//  The class has been written assuming it will be read and modified
//  by users with little coding experience, and is thus obsessively
//  commented with that audience in mind.
//
//  To test the Betweener hardware and see examples of how to use this
//  library, load and run the sketch betweener_hardware_tests.ino
//
//  ADDITIONAL CREDITS:
//      Betweener hardware design: Joseph Kramer
//      This code uses code snippets from:
//          Sebastian Tomczak (MCP4922 write function)

//conflicts in parameter and function definitions in certain cases

//Here is where we include all the other Arduino libraries that this
//depends on.  We're using the updated "Bounce2" library because it
//is more compatible with being used in other libraries
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <SPI.h>
#include <Bounce2.h>
#include <MIDI.h>
#include <ResponsiveAnalogRead.h>


//This is where we define hard-wired pin associations.
//These are "preprocessor directive" statements (with # symbol) instead of
//variable definitions.  We use uppercase names in order to make it
//easy to tell that these are not normal variables when we invoke them in the
//code.  The difference is that #define statements are only implemented when
//the code is compiled, and never when the code is just being run.
//That makes it impossible for any of the code to actively change these
//parameters while it is running, which is a good idea since the
//definitions relate to hard-wired configuration choices.

//SPI is a communication protocol used for the digital-analog-converters (DACs)
//in the device.  These are used to create the CV outputs.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Now we define the Betweener class, which will let us make Betweener objects
//in our sketches.  The class organizes a set of functions (called "methods") and
//the set of variables that they use and control.  A special method called the
//"constructor" is the one that initially builds the object and puts in all the
//default variable definitions.  The other methods provide a flexible interface
//for defining how the Betweener maps inputs to outputs and for controlling
//its read/write operations and other operations.
//
//All variables and all methods get declared in this .h file, but the actual
//code for the functions themselves lives in the .cpp file, not here.  The
//.h file does have some core definitions of defaults for some variables, but
//mostly it exists to tell the compiler how much space to allocate when
//building a Betweener object, and what kinds of structures to expect the
//Betweener objects to contain.  The compiler then looks in the .cpp file to
//fill in the details of the actual functions/code.

    //The "public" parts of the Betweener class are the ways a user will interact
    //with it.  This includes the "constructor" function (which has the same name
    //as the class itself) that makes and initializes individual Betweener objects
    //in user code. It also includes the functions you will use to make the
    //Betweener do what you want with reading, writing, etc.

    // INPUT FUNCTIONS
    // these are the functions for making the Betweener read inputs.
    // you have two choices for how to handle inputs...
    // you can ask Betweener to read everything and just store the
    // numbers, whicih you then retrieve and deal with yourself,
    // or you can ask it to perform a read and give you back a number
    // for an individual channel.

    //these read functions load up current values of all inputs into
    //the object.  Access those by accessing member variables, e.g.
    // b.curentCV1

    //ends up being a low when it hits the chip, thus a rising trigger
    //is actually read in as a falling trigger.  These functions do the right thing
    //so you don't have to keep track of it.
