# SimonSaysSeeq
Simon Says Seeq is a modeless (one function per knob / button) gate sequencer, associated CV envelope generator / VCA / audio delay and midi looper that is designed to drive pitch (or other modulation) most likely via a pitch quantizer.

The software (in various forms) runs on Teensy based hardware and Bela Salt.

Each implementation has different functions e.g. audio looping / VCA is only available on the Bela Salt so far.
