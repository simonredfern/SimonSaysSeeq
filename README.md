# SimonSaysSeeq

Simon Says Seeq is a *modeless* (one function per knob / button) **[Gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code) gate sequencer, triggered CV envelope generator / audio delay / VCA and midi looper**.

## Why? 

I wanted to create melodies and rhythms easily (but not randomly).

I wanted to loop midi easily (always on looping).

The gate / CV outputs were created to drive a pitch quantizers via attenuator/offsets and so create repeatable yet dynamic melodies.

## Platforms                  

The software (in various forms) runs on Teensy based hardware and also Bela Salt (embedded Linux).

The platform implementations support some different features e.g. Audio looping / VCA is only available on the Bela Salt so far.
