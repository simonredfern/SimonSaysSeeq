# SimonSaysSeeq

Simon Says Seeq is a *modeless* (one function per knob / button) **[Gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code) gate sequencer, triggered CV envelope generator / audio delay / VCA and midi looper**.

## Why? 

I wanted to create melodies and rhythms easily (but not randomly).

I wanted to loop midi easily (always on looping).

The gate / CV outputs were created to drive a pitch quantizers via attenuator/offsets and so create repeatable yet dynamic melodies.

## Platforms                  

The software (in various forms) runs on Teensy based hardware and also Bela Salt (embedded Linux).

All the platforms have the Gray code sequencer and CV envelop outs. Some have midi looping and some have audio looping / VCA.
