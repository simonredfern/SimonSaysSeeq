# SimonSaysSeeq
Simon Says Seeq is a simple and modeless (one function per control) gate sequencer, associated CV envelope generator and midi looper that is designed to drive pitch (or other modulation) most likely via a pitch quantizer.

This software (in various forms) runs on Teensy based hardware and more recently on Bela Salt too.
