# SimonSaysSeeq
Simon Says Seeq is a simple and hopefully modeless gate sequencer with associated CV envelope generator (and midi looper) that is designed to drive pitch (or other modulation) most likely via a pitch quantizer.

This software (in various forms) is designed to run using Teensy based hardware and more recently on Bela Salt too.
